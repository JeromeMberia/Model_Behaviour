# Introduction
The wholesale customer dataset is a dataset containing transactions done by a wholesale distributor over a period of time in Portugal. The dataset contains information on the clients of a wholesale distributor, and more specifically:
Consumer annual spending (m.u.) on: fresh products, milk products, grocery products, frozen products, detergents and paper products, delicatessen products
Retail channel: Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) vs Retail channel (Nominal)
Purchase region: Lisbon, Oporto or Other.

Model Behaviour as a team will be looking to explore the dataset from Kaggle and use machine learning clustering models to make a customer segmentation.
